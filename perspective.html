            <p>This was going to be a lot of perspective practice and exploration that I've done but I realized that I don't have very many pictures of my work let alone ones that are presentable so I'm also going to be talking about my perspective and approach to design here.</p>

            <p>I feel like design in it's nature is about making life easier for other people. 
                I think that's why I'm more drawn to it that just the fine art I was more familiar with earlier in my life.
                Designers want to create beautiful things that function well and improve the experiences of consumers whether that be through ease of use, instructional value, or just simply aesthetics. 
                Because of this design is both rewarding and sometimes a bit taxing. 
                It's the process of creating but with the intention of other people consuming it.
                It really is such a rewarding process and something I see myself doing for the rest of my life not just career wise but also just integrating it into my day to day.</p>

            <p>Something that I am working on right now is my process. 
                I believe there is a balance in process. 
                Somewhere I can have enough of a structured linear process that can in most instances guide me in the right direction while still letting me explore possibilities and try things that might not lead to a final result. 
                As a base for this process, fundamentals in understanding composition in 2D as well as construction in 3D will allow me to further explore more subtle things and how they can influence feelings, thinking, among other things. 
                I hope this makes sense. I'm still on my discovery and learning about design journey.</p>
