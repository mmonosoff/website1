            <p>This was going to be a lot of perspective practice and exploration that I've done but I realized that I don't have very many pictures of my work let alone ones that are presentable so I'm also going to be talking about my perspective and approach to design here.</p>

            <p>I feel like design in it's nature is about making life easier for other people. We want to create beautiful things that function well and improve the experiences of consumers whether that me through ease of use, instructional value, or just simply aesthetics. Because of this design is both rewarding and sometimes a bit taxing but I couldn't ask for anymore. It really is such a rewarding process and something i see myself doing for the rest of my life not just career wise but also just in my day to day life.</p>

            <p>Something that I am working on right now is my process. I think there is a balance in process where I can have enough of a structured linear process that can in most instances guide me in the right direction while still letting me explore possibilities and try things that might not lead to a final result. As a base for this process fundamentals in understanding composition in 2D as well as construction in 3D will allow me to further explore more subtle things. I hope this makes sense. I'm still on my discovery and learning about learning about design journey.</p>
