            <p>I've dabbled in the CreativeCloud occasionally but this year I really got into learning the programs. From Illustrator to Photoshop, Lightroom, and AfterEffects I've trudged through learning and have come out the other side familiarized with them. I still have a lot of learning to do especilly with nuances and sneakily hidden tricks and shortcuts but the foundation has been laid.</p>

            <p>Hooded seals are an endangered animal that are distinguishable through their brightly colored "hood" that protrudes from their noses. In this poster I used a limited color pallette of only 7 colors, any variance is done simply through stripped pattering. I thought this was pretty cool.</p>
