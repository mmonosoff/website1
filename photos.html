            <p>One of the classes that was a requirement for me this past year was photo design. It mostly consisted of taking pictures and telling narratives through them. My professor Dylan (hi dylan if you're here) was amazing and relaly opened my eyes to what photography can do and present itself as. I think what I enjoyed the most about the process of being exposed to more media like photography is how it slowly changes my life. I know it sounds dramatic but photo design for example pushed me to explore Pittsburgh and take chances sometimes doing things that didn't produce the results I wanted but I learned from them. I can't ask for more than that. Most of these pictures are meant to be viewed with others from that same batch but I haven't put them together yet. That has been put onto the to do list.</p>
