            <p>This was going to be a lot of perspective practice and exploration that I've done but I realized that I don't have very many pictures of my work let alone ones that are presentable so I'm also going to be talking about my perspective and approach to design here.</p>

            <p>Something that I am working on right now is my process. I think there is a balance in process where I can have enough of a structured linear process that can in most instances guide me in the right direction while still letting me explore possibilities and try things that might not lead to a final result. As a base for this process fundamentals in understanding composition in 2D as well as construction in 3D will allow me to further explore more subtle things. I hope this makes sense. I'm still on my discovery and learning about learning about design journey.</p>
