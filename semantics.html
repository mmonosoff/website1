            <p>From this set of exercises I came away with a better understanding of the three main categories of a form (dominant, subdominant, and subordinate).
                When there is a limitation either because of time or material the first things to be bargained away should be what provides the least/isn't the body or meat of the final product.
                Essentially build out from the basics.

            <p>Starfish, natural form explorationa and observation. Naunces, replication, understanding limtations of medium.
                <br><br>I started off with clay for the starfish since I'm the most familiar with that of the three mediums we could use (clay, foam, and conservation board).
                It was a bit challenging to get the details blocked in because the clay has a oil base meaning that it never dried and any bump would leave a mark.
                While working on the foam starfish I realized that because of the difference in medium, skills, and tools involved the form needed to be simplified.
                I decided to forgo detailing and raising out many of the nubs because they were not as important to the body and feeling of the form.

            <p>The mouse, or man made object, was a bit harder to capture. 
                Curves and smooth edges produced by a machine just are much more difficult to replicate by hand. 
                The hardest one of the two replicas was the paper mouse, creating a cohesive and "solid" form through negative space is probably as difficult as you imagine it to be.
                In order to capture teh curves I did a lot of measuring but for refinement I essentially just went by hand feel.
                How close does this structure in my hand feel to the original?
                Feeling is sometimes, especially in cases like this, just as important if not more important than "knowing".
