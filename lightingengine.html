            <p>ONly using white paper, adhesives, and minimal structural items liek wire create a lighting engine that either will function as a task lamp or ambient lighting. Consider different tones and stocks of paper, the mark that adhesives leave or how light shines through the materials chosen.</p>

            <p>I wanted to create a light that would encourage people to customize and interact with its. very often I feel that ambient lighting is jsut meant to be looked at and only gives one feeling or mood. My goal was to be able to have people adjust teh light as they saw fit.</p>
