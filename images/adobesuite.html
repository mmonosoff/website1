            <p>I've previously played around in CreativeCloud but this year I really got into learning the programs. 
                From Illustrator to Photoshop, Lightroom, and AfterEffects I've trudged through learning and have come out the other side familiarized with them. 
                I still have a lot of learning to do especially with sneakily hidden tricks and shortcuts but the foundation has been laid and I've thoroughly enjoyed the process.</p>

            <p>Hooded seals are an endangered animal that primarily live in the artic and are distinguishable by their brightly colored "hood" that protrudes from their noses. 
                In this poster there is a limited color pallette of only 7 colors, any variance is done simply through stripped pattering. 
                I thought this was pretty cool : ).</p>

            <p>In a 10 second animation using the same restriction of 7 colors and patterns, show hooded seals in their natural habitat and behaviours. 
                Also make all the sounds effects to accompany the animation.</p>
